    <td>This week in IT we were learning about safety in general. I believe that this was a very important lesson because it will help us in our later life. Mr Keen used real life examples which happened to people recently in our surrounding area. I will not go into the details because I feel that they are not very nice and not needed but I feel that I really learnt what sort of dangers we can face in the world. 

As well as this we looked into the details about how we could be punished and what for. The example we were looking at was to do with sexual assault and we learnt that even if you just watched it you could get done.

In this lesson I learnt some really valuable life lessons and learnt that even if you do not do anything and don't try to help you can still get into a lot of trouble.
