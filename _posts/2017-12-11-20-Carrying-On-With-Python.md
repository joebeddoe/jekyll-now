    <td>Today in I.T. we carried on with python. We found a new resource to help us with python and used it today(I will leave a link below). We focused on two things in the lesson today and for homework. This was for() loops and while() loops. A for() loop tells the computer how many times to run a certain a piece of code however a while() loop tells the computer to run the code until something happens for example the score >200. 

I believe that I worked well today however I think I could have worked quite a bit faster than I did. I feel that to do this I could have concentrated a bit better and focused more on the task at hand. I think that to improve on what I did this lesson I need to block out any noise made in class other than the teacher.

For homework as well as writing this blog I had to fill in a worksheet on for() and while() loops which I found relatively easy.
