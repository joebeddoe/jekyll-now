    <td>This week in I.T. We changed classes and have a new teacher. We have now started repl.it which is a website in which you can create your own code on lots of different types of program types, if that's how you say itâ€¦ We used python 3 and recapped the basics such as "print()".

This week I think that the thing which really helped me was perseverance. I had to persevere to figure out what to use. As well as perseverance which helped my I think that I had to really listen to the instructions that I was given. By following the instructions it helped me use the right pieces of code and put the code in the right order.

I think that next time I could have worked a bit quicker because I did notice that at some points I was slightly behind. To improve this I just think that I need to practise coding more and more often to help me. I do think that I will practise more because I am sure that I will be set lots of homework.

I really enjoyed this week and I hope to enjoy next week! </td>
