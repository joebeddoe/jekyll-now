    <td>This week in I.T we carried on with the repl project where we are trying to create an AI which speaks to you like a normal person would. I believe that the key to success in this project is perseverance because if you do not try and persevere then you're ai will not be complete.

This week to help us we were shown some of the Ais which had already been made. They were not good. What they did was pick out keywords in the sentences and would have sentences of their own linked to these words. So if I said I like eating tomatoes the ai might say a face about tomatoes.

We used lots of different Ais but none of them were very good. These Ais were all internet ais so not made by big companies like the other ais which are very good-  Alexa (amazon), Google home (google) and Siri (apple).                                                                           </td>
