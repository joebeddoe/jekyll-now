    <td>In the last four weeks of school in I.T we have been learning how to use google sheets to break code without having to type every single thing out. For example when trying to create a way to translate the coded message back into what it first was we found a way to make the program type out the numbers for you. 

From these lessons I have learnt many things but I think the most useful thing that I have learnt in the past week is that there are loads of shortcuts and if you put your mind to it you can and will find a way to make your life easier.

Throughout the past few lessons I have got stuck many times however ninety-nine times out of a hundred you can always find a way out of what you're stuck on. So far in I.T I have learnt that if you put your mind to it you can cut corners and find away out of stuff.
