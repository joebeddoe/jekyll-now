    <td>I learnt a lot this lesson. I really learnt that although stuff can look really hard it can be quite simple. I realized this when I saw some of Mr Keen's work on repl. It was really cool how I understood quite a lot of the code, and how much code there was. It inspired me to work harder in the future and showed me what I could potentially when I am older. 

In the lesson we recapped what the difference between a function and a procedure. Which by the way is a function wants a return (an input from the person) where as a procedure does not want a return. In our buzzfeed quiz we will be using both functions and procedures to help us build our code easily and quickly. On our repl this week we had to make a list of the questions in order so they could be called one after the other. We also started doing this for the options which the person doing the quiz could choose from. 

for inspiration we had a look at Mr Keenâ€™s buzzfeed quiz which was very clever even if the questions were quite stupid.  I enjoyed this lesson because I learnt a lot, persevered a lot and got given a lot of inspiration which i can use in the future!
