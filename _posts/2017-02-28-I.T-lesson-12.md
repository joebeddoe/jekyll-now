    <td>this was our third week of python and I started off the lesson not very well however about 10 minutes into the lesson I started getting my speed up (which is very fast) and tried to the best of my ability. I think that my perseverance this week really helped me get quite a lot of work done this week.</td>

    <td>this week I should have got started quicker because if I had I may have reached my target or at least got closer. I am also going to try like last week and work faster by typing quicker because it will really help me and my learning.</td>

    <td>I am going to start quicker by lining up first and when I get into the classroom I will crack on straight away. I will improve my learning by typing quicker and I will type quicker because of practice and I will ask about things I am really stuck on or don't understand.</td>
