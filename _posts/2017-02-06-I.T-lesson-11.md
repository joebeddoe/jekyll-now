    <td>this was our second week of python and I started off the lesson pretty well however about halfway through the lesson we got stuck for the rest of the lesson. We persevered and persevered but we (my friends were also stuck on it) couldn't figure it out. My blog a the time of writing is not working and I have no idea why. I have checked w3schools and the piece of code which it says there is an error on is correct (at least I think it is).</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I sometime I need to ask the teacher because when I got stuck for ages I should have alameda and learnt from my mistakes. I am also going to try like last week and work faster by typing quicker because it will really help me and my learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by typing quicker and I will type quicker because of practice and I will ask about things I am really stuck on or don't understand.</td>
