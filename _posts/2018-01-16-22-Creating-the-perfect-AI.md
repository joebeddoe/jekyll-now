    <td>This week in IT we learnt about what is actually random, for example we looked at Spotify where when you shuffle the music and you never get two songs in a row, this is because people complained that it was "not random enough" so Spotify changed it and now here we are. Computers cannot make something random because they are not random but a company made a code which does make a random number which big companies like google, apple and amazon use so it can be done but it just takes a lot of time and effort.

We wanted to experiment so we played an online game of backgammon where it seems to be rigged because the computer always gets good rolls and we always got the worst possible rolls.

As well as this we looked at our teachers code on python where he created a game where the computer generates a random number and you have to guess it which was fun, when we did it we got it in 5 tries. 

Here below I will put my python work which I have been working on for the past few weeks:                                          </td>
