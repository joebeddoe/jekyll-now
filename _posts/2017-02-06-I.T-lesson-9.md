    <td>I think that what i learned this week was that in coding and I.T you have to get every little detail right. At the start of the lesson i had a decent, but working blog and at the time of writing i have NOTHING. This is because when i tried to add tables into my blog it worked slightly and then i tried to change the rest to to make sure that the colours didnt hurt eyes. When doing this i somehow messed up. This is probably because i wasn't concentrating. When i got home i used W3schools to try and fix the problem but sadly i didnâ€™t find a way to fix it. So i started again and the blog posts wouldnt go on to the website.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my bad attention to detail limited my learning because i spent precious time finding out that i had missed the semi-colon or missed the speech marks when replacing my background image or my icon. I also need to realise my mistakes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will take my time and this will save me time and save me from going over my line of code again and again and again. If i do make a mistake i will fix when the mistake occurs and nt in 5 minutes time because i will have forgotten how to. And finally i will try and perservere more and not give up so easily.</td>
