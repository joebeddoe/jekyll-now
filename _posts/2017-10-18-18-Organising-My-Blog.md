    <td>In my most recent lesson in I.T. and for upcoming weeks I have been organising my blog and choosing how to format it without the table the school provided. I am still using a table because I think it keeps my work organised. Although I'm not using a complicated table.
Another thing that I’m changing is the names of my blogs. They used to be Blog 17, Blog 18 and so on. But now I’m changing the names to things which would make you want to read it or at least explain what i did in the lesson. 

This week I didn’t really get stuck for the things I am doing I have done before and I find really quite easy. The things I’m doing include renaming my posts, layering out my blogs, removing old blogs as well as posting new and improved ones
