    <td>This week in IT we were learning about buzzfeed quizzes. These quizzes are where you have to answer questions and then they give you what they are. For example I did a quiz on what Harry Potter house are you in and they would ask me questions such as, what would your pet be… over the next few weeks we are going to making our own quizzes like these because I know it so well I am going to be doing one which tells you which Harry Potter house you are in?
